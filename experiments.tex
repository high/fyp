\subsection{Performance metrics} % (fold)
\label{sub:experiments_performance_metrics}

To be able to measure the performance in the EPRiDe implementation against BDBe, a number of performance metrics have been established. These performance metrics have been selected due to the fact that they can be measured in single-master replication, distributed-master replication and in multi-master replication.
